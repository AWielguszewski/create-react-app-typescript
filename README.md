Create React apps (with Typescript) with no build configuration.

* [Getting Started](#tldr) â€“ How to use 'create react app'.

_Do you know react and want to try out typescript? Or do you know typescript and want to try out react?_ Get all the benefits from `create-react-app` but you use typescript! ðŸš€

## How to start

```sh
npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app my-app --scripts-version pretty-typed-react-starter
cd my-app/
npm start or yarn start
```

## About

This is a variation of the 'create react app' with custom scripts and template. Full `Progressive Web App (PWA)` integration is implemented in this project with offline-first strategy, custom splash screen, icons and configurable service worker.

#### note about Lighthouse results:

_To make the result a 5x 100 you need to try server-side rendering for the main component, enable HTTPS and use 'cache-control' header for the serviceWorker file on your server_

## Features:

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - _note:_ replaced ES/TSlint. To make it work you need to install it in your editor (for more info check out the official documentation)
* [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) - Easier than Redux yet equally powerfull and fun to use.
* [React Loadable](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable) - Code-splitting made easy. Works great with current webpack configuration from create react app. Example included in the template.
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor with `node-sass-chokidar` package
* [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - basic routing with PWA support (HashRouter)
* [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) - with `workbox` i replaced standard approach to PWA that was shipped with default `create-react-app` config. The service worker is now fully configurable in `/src/serviceWorker`. It is pre-configured in `Webpack` to include `.js .html and .css` files in the precache manifest but exclude any images.

## Concept

The project structure is created with separation of logic from view and code-splitting in mind.
Ideally you keep your logic in the `Containers` and view in `Components`.
Typical structure for a `Container/Component` would be :

```
Container/Component
    â””â”€â”€ index.tsx (main file)
    â””â”€â”€ dynamic.tsx (dynamically loaded export made from react-loadable
    â””â”€â”€ types.ts (exported types)
    â””â”€â”€ styles.scss (styles for that specific Container/Component)
```
